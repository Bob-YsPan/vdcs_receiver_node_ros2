# VDCS receiver Node for ROS 2
This repo need to work with mine's https://github.com/Bob-YsPan/linorobot2_hardware project, for my master degree's research, build and replace the script under my `linorobot2_hardware` to test it  
You also need the script in the `src/vdcs_receiver_node/mod_script_for_linorobot2` to make linorobot2 can launch this stack!
